  <div class="theory-section">
    <h2>1. Musical Notes</h2>
    <div class="theory-content">
      <p>Musical notes represent the pitch and duration of a sound in music. The standard notes in music are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A, B, C, D, E, F, G (The natural notes)</li>
        <li>Sharp (#) and Flat (b) are used to modify the pitch.</li>
        <li>For example, C# is one semitone higher than C, and Bb is one semitone lower than B.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Here is an example of a note:</strong> A is the note that is played on the 1st string of a guitar on the 5th fret.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="theory-section">
    <h2>2. Time Signatures</h2>
    <div class="theory-content">
      <p>A time signature indicates the number of beats in each measure (bar) of music. The most common time signatures are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>4/4:</strong> Four beats per measure, and each beat is a quarter note.</li>
        <li><strong>3/4:</strong> Three beats per measure, and each beat is a quarter note.</li>
        <li><strong>6/8:</strong> Six beats per measure, and each beat is an eighth note.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Time signatures help musicians to understand the rhythm of the music and how to count each beat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="theory-section">
    <h2>3. Chords</h2>
    <div class="theory-content">
      <p>A chord is a group of notes played together. The most basic types of chords are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Major Chords:</strong> A chord consisting of a root note, major third, and perfect fifth. (E.g., C Major = C, E, G)</li>
        <li><strong>Minor Chords:</strong> A chord consisting of a root note, minor third, and perfect fifth. (E.g., A Minor = A, C, E)</li>
        <li><strong>Seventh Chords:</strong> A chord consisting of a root note, major third, perfect fifth, and a seventh note. (E.g., C7 = C, E, G, Bb)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="theory-section">
    <h2>4. Scales</h2>
    <div class="theory-content">
      <p>A scale is a series of notes ordered by pitch. The two most common types of scales are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Major Scale:</strong> A scale that follows a specific pattern of whole and half steps (W-W-H-W-W-W-H). (E.g., C Major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C)</li>
        <li><strong>Minor Scale:</strong> A scale that has a more somber tone, often with a different pattern of whole and half steps. (E.g., A Minor: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="theory-section">
    <h2>5. Key Signatures</h2>
    <div class="theory-content">
      <p>A key signature is a symbol placed at the beginning of a staff to indicate which notes are sharp or flat throughout the piece of music. The most common key signatures are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>C Major:</strong> No sharps or flats.</li>
        <li><strong>G Major:</strong> One sharp (F#).</li>
        <li><strong>F Major:</strong> One flat (Bâ™­).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Key signatures help musicians identify the scale or tonality of the piece of music.</p>
